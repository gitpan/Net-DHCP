Revision history for Perl extension Net::DHCP.

*** 0.65  Apr 22 2006

Added a sample DHCP Server and tester: dhcpd.pl & dhcpd_test.pl in 
the examples folder.

*** 0.64  Mar 06 2006

Added removeOption() function

*** 0.63  Jan 01 2006

Major bug corrected in Net::DHCP::Packet->new() while parsing
attributes.

*** 0.62  Oct 07 2005

Minor change to make module compatible Perl 5.6.0 instead of
only 5.8.0.

*** 0.61  Apr 29 2005

Changed minimal acceptable packet length in marshall() method.

*** 0.60  Mar 29 2005

Lots of tests added.

getOption() and addOption() removed and replaced by:
- getOptionValue() & addOptionValue() which provide automatic
  type conversion to/from text representation
- getOptionRaw() & addOptionRaw() to manipulate binary
  format packed into strings.
new() now behaves differently for DHCP options, requiring text
values and not packed binary values.

toString() now escapes unprintable characters.

Added methods : ciaddrRaw, giaddrRaw, siaddrRaw, yiaddrRaw that
use packed binary formats. They are provided for performance enhancements
when you want to avoid unnecessary type conversion.

Pad options (0x00) are now supported.

Example of DHCPLeaseQuery provided by John A. Murphy.

*** 0.53  Mar 02 2005

Performance enhancement in Packet->new() avoirding unnecessary
type conversion and function calls.

Support for DHCPLEASEQUERY, Cisco extension (draft-ietf-dhc-leasequery-05.txt).
Corrected bug in Packet->new() not allowing '0' in Hlen and Htype parameters.
Thanks to John A. Murphy.

*** 0.52  Feb 24 2005

Performance enhancements in Packet.pm.

*** 0.51  Feb 20 2005

Added encoding and decoding functions for Relay Agent information
(option 82 - RFC 3046).

Comment field added in the Packet object. This lets you put any comment
in the Packet object, such as a transaction number. This field not processed.

*** 0.50  Feb  8 2005

Deeply rewritten version based on Net::DHCP v0.11 by Francis
van Dun.

Net::DHCP::Session is momentarily missing, it should be
reintroduced soon.
